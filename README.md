Overview
--------

A simplistic implementation of Bukkit's ItemCase.

Command:

* /itemcase add

Then while holding an item, tap on a slab or glass block.  This will create an
itemcase with that item.

To destroy, just destroy the block where the itemcase was placed.


Documentation
-------------

Case data is placed on a file in the world folder.  This is
loaded during world load and unloaded during unload.

Available sub-commands:

* /itemcase add  
  Adds an ItemCase with object on hand.
* /itemcase cancel  
  Aborts an `add` operation.
* /itemcase respawn  
  Debug sub-command.  Re-creates all ItemCases.

### Configuring

By default you need to place items on Slabs or on Glass blocks.  This
is **classic** mode.  You can, if you want, enable **new wave** mode.
This would let you place items on any type of blocks.  To enable this,
modify the `config.yml` file:

    settings:
      classic: true

Change the line `classic` from `true` to `false`.  Note that **new
wave** mode is experimental and has not been fully tested.

### Permission Nodes:

* itemcase.cmd: allow players access to the itemcase command
* itemcase.destroy: allow players destroy cases
